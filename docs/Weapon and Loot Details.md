Weapon and Loot Details
Weapon Types: What are the specific weapon types (e.g., Pressure Washer, Laser Cutter, Waste Escape Pod)? For each, what are the base stats (power, cooldown, range, shape, grid size, heat gen/resist, HP, scrap cost)? How do rarities modify these (e.g., +20% power for Rare)?
    I would love to have base weapon types that are the foundation of how that weapon functions, basically a weapon type controls the base level/variables of that weapon and better versions of that weapon modify those variables.  In addition, certain adjectives can be added to a weapon to make it even better, like adjectives in Diablo or Borderlands.  For example, a "Rapid-Fire Laser Cutter" would have a faster cooldown than a normal Laser Cutter, or a "High-Capacity Waste Escape Pod" would hold more scrap than a normal Waste Escape Pod. In addition to adjectives, rarities would also modify base stats. Also, adjectives may add special function to a normal weapon, like a "Freezing Pressure Washer" that slows enemies on hit.
    Weapon Types could include:
    - Pressure Washer
    - Laser Cutter
    - Waste Escape Pod
    - Flame Thrower
    - Railgun
    - Missile Launcher
    - Plasma Rifle
    - Electric Arc
    and then some weapons could affect flow like
    - Time Dilation Field
    - Gravity Well Projector
    Every weapon type would have its own base stats like power, cooldown, range, shape, grid size, heat generation/resistance, HP, and scrap cost.  Rarities could modify these stats in various ways, such as increasing power, reducing cooldown, or enhancing heat resistance.
    Each weapon would function, gameplay wise and visually, according to its type.  For example, a Pressure Washer would shoot a high-pressure stream of water that damages enemies and cools down nearby weapons, while a Laser Cutter would emit a focused beam of energy that slices through enemies with precision.

Rarity Modifiers: What rarities exist (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary)? What specific stat changes do they apply (e.g., Cooldown -10% for Uncommon, Power +20% for Rare)?
    We'll need to tweak modifiers to ensure balance and gameplay variety once we've created more of the gameplay systems.

Loot Generation: When do drops occur (e.g., after each enemy, wave, or both)? Any special rules (e.g., bosses drop higher rarities)?
    Scrap drops from each enemy killed.  Enemy difficulty would increase scraps dropped. Bosses would drop more scrap, and an instant shift upgrade selection (as if they just leveled up). enemies would get more difficult after each wave. after a set number of waves, a boss would spawn. The shift would last indefinitely until the player dies, so the longer they survive, the more difficult enemies become, but the more scrap and credits they can earn. After they 'die' they will get graded on performance (likely based on waves survived, enemies killed, accuracy, etc) and earn credits based on that performance. 

Weapon Scrapping: How many credits per weapon, based on rarity? Any other benefits?
    Weapons can be scrapped for credits based on their rarity.
    Scrapping a weapon mid-shift could also provide a large amount of scraps as a bonus, but it wouldn't be for credits, encouraging players to make strategic decisions about their loadout, and sacrificing credits for longer runs.

Enemy Details

Enemy Types and Variations: For basic, armored, fast, boss—base HP, speed, damage, resistances? How do variations work (±20% random, or specific tiers)?
    Since the enemies are 'waste' we have a lot of opportunities for different enemy types.  Basic enemies could be small piles of trash that move slowly and have low HP.  Armored enemies could be larger piles of trash with metal scraps mixed in, making them tougher to kill.  Fast enemies could be small, mobile robots made from waste that move quickly and deal moderate damage. Boss enemies could be large, heavily armored constructs made from compacted waste that require strategic thinking to defeat.
    Variations could work by having specific tiers for each enemy type, with each tier having a set of base stats that increase in difficulty.  For example, a basic enemy could have three tiers: Tier 1 (low HP, slow speed), Tier 2 (moderate HP, moderate speed), and Tier 3 (high HP, fast speed). Each tier would have a specific set of stats that define its difficulty level.

Enemy Abilities: Any special attacks or behaviors (e.g., ranged attacks, area damage, healing)?
    Enemies could have a variety of special attacks and behaviors to keep gameplay interesting. For example:
    - Ranged Attacks: Some enemies could splatter when shot by projectiles, causing damage from a distance.
    - Area Damage: Certain enemies could explode upon death, dealing area damage to nearby weapons.
    - Healing: Some enemies could have the ability to repair themselves or other enemies over time, making them more challenging to defeat.
    - Status Effects: Enemies could inflict status effects on weapons, such as slowing down their cooldowns or increasing heat generation.

Enemy Attacks: Can enemies damage weapons? If so, how much damage per hit, and which enemies?
    This will depend, we can tweak this later.  At first, most 'waste' won't damage your weapons..  the higher likelihood of damage will come from overheating your weapons due to poor heat management.  However, certain enemies, especially bosses, could have attacks that damage weapons directly.  For example, a boss enemy could have a powerful slam attack that deals significant damage to nearby weapons, or a ranged attack that targets specific weapons and deals moderate damage.

Shift Boosts and Economy

Boost Types and Effects: Specific boosts (e.g., "Cooldown Reduction: -10% to all weapons" or "Heat Dissipation: -5 heat per second")? How many rarities affect strength (e.g., Common: -5%, Legendary: -25%)?
    Boosts could be categorized into different types, such as Cooldown Reduction, Heat Dissipation, Scrap Gain, Weapon Power, and Defensive Boosts. Each boost type would have specific effects that enhance the player's performance during a shift. For example:
    - Cooldown Reduction: Reduces the cooldown time of all weapons by a certain percentage.
    - Heat Dissipation: Increases the rate at which weapons cool down, reducing heat buildup.
    - Scrap Gain: Increases the amount of scrap earned from enemies.
    - Weapon Power: Increases the damage output of all weapons.
    - Defensive Boosts: Reduces damage taken by weapons from enemy attacks.

    Rarities would affect the strength of these boosts. For example:
    - Common: -5% cooldown reduction
    - Uncommon: -10% cooldown reduction
    - Rare: -15% cooldown reduction
    - Epic: -20% cooldown reduction
    - Legendary: -25% cooldown reduction

Scrap Meter and Costs: Thresholds for boosts (e.g., 100, 200, 400 scrap)? Cost progression (e.g., doubles each time)?
    Scrap Meter progression should be small at first, but then compound .. I'm not a math person, but something that would be satisfying to play

Credits and Performance: How are credits calculated (e.g., 10 credits per wave survived + 1 per enemy killed)? Any multipliers for multiplayer?
    Since this is multiplayer, credits will probably be based on some function of scrap earned / players

Characters, Items, and Unlocks

Characters: What special abilities (e.g., "Engineer: +20% weapon HP" or "Scavenger: +10% scrap gain")?
    I'd love for players to get a deep bench of characters they can decide to play as.  Some characters can do special things like repair weapons, create portals, throw waste clearing thermal detonators, use lightsabers, blasters, etc.  
One-Time Items: Examples (e.g., "Invincibility Potion: 10 seconds of immunity" or "Heat Shield: Temporarily reduce heat by 50")?
    Really anything could work here since it's one time stuff.  Resurection potions, whatever.  The sky is the limit.  These too, would have rarities and increasingly better benefits, and could be scraped for in shift scrap bonuses OR cash afterwards.
Unlock Progression: Order for characters, weapon types, items? Prerequisites (e.g., need 1000 credits for first character)?
    Some characters would be unlocked via achievements (getting through 4 waves, defeating 2 bosses in a shift, etc)  some would be just from cash, with diff. costs.  Some would be based on total shifts played, multiplayer, etc.  Fun unlocks with goofy requirements like Megabonk and Vampire Survivors.

UI and Balancing

UI Elements: How to display inventory (grid/list?), boost choices (popup with 3 options?), loot boxes (animation?), scrap meter (progress bar)?
    We'll have to tweak this obviously. But in the Locker Room they should see everything in their 'locker' (inventory) and drag and drop which weapons they want to their toolbelt (action bar) the inventory should be filterable by type (weapon, one time use, skills, etc)
Balancing Numbers: Heat cap (100), malfunction chance formula, weapon HP values, enemy spawn rates, etc.?
    this will have to be figured out as we go.  The gameplay will dictate how this works really.  The challenge should be fun, most new people should be able to get to the first boss and maybe defeat it. As the difficulty increases, only players with advanced weapons, skills and characters should be able to progress very far
Multiplayer Aspects: How are boosts/shares handled (e.g., individual or team-wide)? Credits/loot per player?
    Boosts are per player, but scrap is divided between the players.  Credits are based on group performance at the end.
